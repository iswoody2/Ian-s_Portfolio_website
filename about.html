            <h2>About me </h2>        
            <p> 
                Hi, I'm Ian. I'm a law graduate who discovered a passion for technology during my 
                final year of study. While researching space law and artificial intelligence law, I attended a lecture on legal tech, 
                which opened my eyes to the incredible innovation happening in the intersection of law and technology.
                 That moment was a turning point for me—I realized that I could do more than just practice law. 
                 I wanted to be part of shaping the future of legal services. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To pursue this new path, I enrolled in a Master's program in Computer Science, where I'm deepening my understanding 
                of programming and technology. My goal is to leverage these skills to improve the legal field and make life easier 
                for lawyers and clients alike. I'm particularly inspired by the growing legal tech ecosystem, with startups like Robin 
                and Leya showing the potential for groundbreaking change.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I'm excited about opportunities in the legal tech space and beyond. Whether it's as a software engineer, data engineer, 
                or data analyst, I am eager to apply my unique blend of legal knowledge and technical skills to create transformative 
                solutions. My journey is just beginning, and I'm ready to learn, grow, and make a lasting impact in the tech world.
